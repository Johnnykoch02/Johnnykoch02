Hello! I’m Jonathan Koch, a driven Software Engineer and AI Researcher with broad experience in both academic and industry settings.

My work spans from developing advanced object manipulation algorithms to designing high-impact ML solutions for image/video enhancement and job-search engines built on congregating the internet. Outside of tech, you can find me playing acoustic guitar, piano, Soccer, or training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
